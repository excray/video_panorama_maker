In this project, we present a method to discover panoramic source frames within web videos. The project is based on existing paper \cite{Feng}.  Videos are a good source for panoramas as camera panning naturally creates a wide field-of-view of a scene. But the problem is challenging because many of the videos are recorded casually, without the intent of capturing a panorama. Our method finds segments within a video that are good candidates for panorama sources. Finding these segments requires extracting the different scenes in the video. After finding these segments, we keep the ones that achieve an optimal balance between maximizing the visual quality and the wide field-of-view. Once these segments are discovered, good quality panoramas are synthesized using them.  Our method was able to detect good quality panoramas in videos with high accuracy. We ran experiments on various web videos to confirm its feasibility and to demonstrate the utility of this method.
