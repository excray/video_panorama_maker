\subsection{Blending} \label{sec:BlendExpSec}

We implemented a three stage blending algorithm as discussed in Section (\ref{sec:ImageStitch}).  
The first stage is a feathering algorithm, common for stitching panoramas.
Feathering algorithms tend to leave ghosting artifacts shown in Figure (\ref{fig:withoutFilter}).
Ghosting artifacts are a result of moving objects between frames.  This is a major problem since we use videos as our panorama sources.
Videos tend to have moving objects.  Our solution was to implement a median-bilateral filter in the second stage.
The median-bilateral filter mitigates ghosting artifacts as shown in Figure (\ref{fig:withFilter}).
